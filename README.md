# Code
The provided Python code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on a housing dataset using the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries. Initially, the dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and its structure and content are examined by displaying the first and last few rows, as well as obtaining information such as the number of rows and columns, column names, data types, and summary statistics. Categorical columns like 'mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', and 'furnishingstatus' are explored and, in the case of 'mainroad', binary values ('yes' and 'no') are converted to numeric values (1 and 0).Moreover, the code investigates the presence of null values in the dataset and generates descriptive statistics for a better understanding of the numerical features. The categorical columns are further analyzed through unique value counts. Finally, a histogram is created for a visual representation of the distribution of numerical features.
